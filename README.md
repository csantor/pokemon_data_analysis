# Pokemon Data Analysis

In this project(done as part of the course Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas by <a href="https://www.jovian.ml">Jovian.ml</a>) I analyzed a pokemon dataset scraped from the <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all">Pokemon Database</a>.

Python libraries used for the scraping and the analysis include requests, beautifulsoup, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
